# Environmental Documentaries on Netflix üåçüì∫üé¨

Welcome to my first project for the Lede Program! This project aims to explore and analyze the selection of environmental, climate, and nature-themed documentaries available on Netflix. The goal is to gain insights into the prevalence of such content and its distribution across different countries.

## Project Overview üëáüèº

This personal project utilizes a dataset downloaded from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv") and leverages the Jupyter Notebook, along with the pandas, for data analysis. This dataset contains information about Netflix's catalog of TV shows and movies, including release years, production countries, genres, description, etc.


## Methodology I've used üìà

1. **Quantifying Environmental Documentaries**: The first phase of this project involves quantifying the number of environmentally-focused documentaries within Netflix's catalog for each country, which allow me to compare the ratio of environmental to non-environmental content available in different regions.

2. **Analysis of Environmental Documentary Production**: Taking a closer look at specific countries such as UK, US, and Brazil to analyze their contributions to environmental documentary production and examining the number of environmental documentaries produced and their percentage in relation to the overall documentary output.

3. **The Evolution of Environmental Awareness**: After diving into the release years of environmental documentaries, I then traced the ebb and flow of eco-awareness over time. This gives me insights into how environmental awareness has evolved in the United Kingdom over the past two decades.

4. **Visualization tools**: Flourish, Matplotlib


## Skills I've Learned üí≠

1. **String manipulation**: Splitting strings in each row of a column and expanding them into separate columns. This skill is useful when dealing with data that contains multiple values within a single field.
2. **Data cleaning**: Removing irrelevant or unnecessary data points manually. While automated data cleaning techniques are often used, there are situations where manual intervention is required to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
3. **Flexibility in visualization approaches**: Recognizing that visualizing data based on geographical land features may not always be necessary or relevant, even when the data is related to countries. Being open to exploring alternative visualization methods beyond geographical maps, such as bar charts, line graphs, or other visual representations that can more effectively communicate the data's story.


## Some Fun Findings! üß©

1. The _United States_ and the _United Kingdom_ stand out as leading contributors to environmental documentaries, with significant numbers of titles produced and was purchased by Netflix.

2. Brazil emerges as a country with a pronounced focus on environmental content, with a substantial proportion of its documentaries centered around environmental topics.

3. The analysis of the United Kingdom's environmental documentaries reveals intriguing trends, with a peak in production occurring in 2015 and 2016.


## Things I would've liked to do üí°

1. **Obtaining a more comprehensive and up-to-date dataset with more devloped scraping skills**
Due to the complexities of Netflix's absence of public API, it was challenging to obtain a comprehensive list of current and past Netflix titles through web scraping. If I had access to Netflix's entire catalog, my project would have provided a more complete and accurate dataset for analysis. Additionally, having information on the dates these documentaries were purchased and when the licenses expire would also have provided valuable insights into the availability and longevity of environmental content on the platform.

2. **Exploring viewership and engagement data**
While the dataset provided information on the existence of environmental documentaries, it would have been fascinating to delve deeper into viewership and engagement metrics. Analyzing data such as the number of views, user ratings, and audience engagement would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the impact and reception of these environmental documentaries among Netflix subscribers.

3. **Analyzing the impact of environmental documentaries on the audiences' end**
I think it would have been interesting to explore how the presence of environmental documentaries on Netflix influenced viewers' choices and preferences in each countries since all continents' Netflix has its own contents. I was also thinking that analyzing data on related recommendations, viewing patterns, and user feedback could also have shed light on the influence of these documentaries in shaping viewers' interest in environmental topics and behaviors.
