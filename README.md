# Environmental Documentaries on Netflix 🌍📺🎬

Welcome to the Environmental Documentaries on Netflix project! This project aims to explore and analyze the selection of environmental, climate, and nature-themed documentaries available on Netflix. The goal is to gain insights into the prevalence of such content and its distribution across different countries.

## Project Overview 👇🏼

This personal project utilizes a dataset downloaded from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv") and leverages the Jupyter Notebook, along with the pandas, for data analysis. This dataset contains information about Netflix's catalog of TV shows and movies, including release years, production countries, genres, description, etc.


## Methodology I've used 📈

1. **Quantifying Environmental Documentaries**: The first phase of the project involves quantifying the number of environmentally-focused documentaries within Netflix's catalog for each country, which allow me to compare the ratio of environmental to non-environmental content available in different regions.

2. **Analysis of Environmental Documentary Production**: We take a closer look at specific countries to analyze their contributions to environmental documentary production, examining the number of environmental documentaries produced and their percentage in relation to the overall documentary output.

3. **The Evolution of Environmental Awareness**: After diving into the release years of environmental documentaries, I then traced the ebb and flow of eco-awareness over time. This gives me insights into how environmental awareness has evolved in the United Kingdom over the past two decades.

4. **Visualization tools**: Flourish
